# fakeCityDataGenerator\
A pseudo-random data generator to create datasets on the fly for education purposes, for a fictional city split into districts\
The script is a simple one written in Python, making use of:\
*random\
*os\
*numpy\
The script will, in its current state, generate two CSV files (examples are included) containing pseudo-random data\
##locations.csv\
This file contains data regarding each of the districts within the city\
There are various forced patterns wihtin the data here that can be found\
##people.csv\
This file contains data regarding 10000 fictional citizens of the city\
This can currently be easily adjusted within the script by altering the length of the loop on line 447 to the desired number\
